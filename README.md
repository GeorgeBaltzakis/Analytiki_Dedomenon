# Enhancing-Maternal-Healthcare-with-Machine-Learning-and-Fetal-Heart-Rate-Analysis

Excited to share my recent project in the field of healthcare analytics and machine learning! üè•üìà

In this project, I leveraged my data analysis and machine learning skills to address a critical issue in maternal healthcare‚Äîfetal heart rate monitoring. The project involved several key phases:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: I started by cleaning a dataset containing fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring information. This involved handling missing data, converting data formats, and removing outliers.

2. **Clustering Analysis**: To gain insights into the data, I employed clustering techniques, including K-Means, DBSCAN, and OPTICS. These methods allowed me to identify patterns and group data points accordingly.

3. **Classification Model**: For the main challenge of the project, I built a classification model using a deep learning framework (Keras). The model was designed to predict fetal heart rate outcomes based on a set of features. I also utilized advanced techniques such as one-hot encoding and the Matthews correlation coefficient to assess the model's performance.

4. **Results and Visualization**: To make the findings more accessible, I created visualizations comparing the original data, cluster labels, and model predictions.

This project showcases my ability to handle healthcare data, apply machine learning algorithms, and deliver actionable insights for improving maternal healthcare. It highlights my passion for using data-driven solutions to address real-world problems.

I'm eager to discuss this project and explore potential collaborations or opportunities in the healthcare analytics domain. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to learn more or if you have any questions about the project. Let's connect and engage in meaningful conversations!
